# database-mapbox-project
# Project should be opened in Google Chrome
# Key has check boxes so user can see different levels of damage
# Larger dots have more casualties
# Click on a dot to see a popup of all the data for that specific crash
# Popup will not appear if zoomed too far out
# Time slider used to see all crashes between different years
# Slider is also used to give map time to load because map box takes a while to load all the data
# Data is from the NTSB https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx
